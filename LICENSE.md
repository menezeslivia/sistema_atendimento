    i.	reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

2.	Other terms and conditions.

  a.	Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights.

In no event shall the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such DAMAGES.
